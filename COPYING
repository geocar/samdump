mkntpw.c is redistributable under the terms of the GNU Public License.
	(see COPYING.GPL for more information)

Sadly, samdump isn't under the GPL.

The only common licenses are:
	* Copyrights must be kept intact (1.1, 3.4)
	* Noncommercial distribution only (1.2, 3.1)
	* Source must be available (3.2, 3.3)

Some parts of varying licenses attempted to cover other people's code. I've gone
through as much as I can and I believe the following copyrights apply to
the various places.

The code written by Internet Connection is deliberately under the GPL. If you
can convince the other copyright holders to give up a GPL license, this file
will be replaced with the GNU Public License.

 * Rules (someone calls it license):
 * The chntpw binary & source can be both changed and distributed
 * by anyone in any way they like if:
 * 1) No one makes money on it (commercial sales is a big NONO)
 *  except: a) Charging for media/packaging/printed docs/support/shipping
 *             is allowed.
 *          b) Inclusion in typical linux, *bsd or similar OS
 *             distributions (also commercial)
 *             is allowed as long as use of chntpw & ntreg is
 *             not the distributions primary purpose. Anyway it's
 *             nice if I get notified any such inclusion.
 * 2) The source must be available (at least as an option)
 * 3) The changed program also follows these rules.
 * 4) As long as code written by me is included, it must give me credit,
 *    at least in the source code and docs.
 *                                                                                 
 * If you ask I will very likely allow other types of distribution.
 * (have already had questions of it as a bonus on eBay auctions.
 *  ask, and you will likely get permission)
 * I'm just a kind of control freak, so I want to know what's going on.
