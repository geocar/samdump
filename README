samdump produces a smbpasswd(5) file from a copy of the NT registry. it supports
SYSKEY, LanMan, and the NT-password schemes. The resulting files are compatible
with Samba and can be used to authenticate the original users.

samdump might work under windows. It won't work with the LIVE registry.
It won't work on platforms that are little-endian (although it could be ported
to)

samdump requires an OFFLINE copy of the registry. You can use NTBACKUP and
mtftar to get one.

---

step 0: edit Makefile to get access to your OpenSSL libs and includes directory,
	make, and install the resulting samdump tool in the location of your
	choosing.

step 1: create a backup of the System State with the NTBACKUP.EXE tool

step 2: unpack the registry

	$ mtftar "System State/Registry//" < storage.bkf > registry.tar

step 3: untar the registry (someplace)

step 4: run samdump on the registry files:

	$ samdump /path/to/registry/* > smbpasswd.txt

step 5: make use of your new smbpasswd file with Samba.

samdump is especially useful in migrating a series of standalone NT or WIN2K
systems to a Samba-controlled domain. it could also be used to migrate
standalone NT or WIN2K systems to a Active-Directory-controlled domain.

the resulting files still would need to be filtered with awk, sort, and uniq to
make sure each user has a unique RID (and if there WERE any collisions, then
permissions might need to be fixed-up after membership changes)
